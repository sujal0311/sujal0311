Hi, I’m Sujal Agarwal, a Computer Science and Engineering student (2022–2026) at B.P. Poddar Institute of Management and Technology with a 9.03 CGPA. I’m passionate about combining technology and creativity to build impactful, scalable solutions that make a real difference.

I specialize in the MERN stack and have a strong foundation in C, C++, and Java. Over the past year, I’ve gained practical experience through internships at ANTLABS and ITJobxs, where I developed AI-powered tools, dashboards, and full-stack web platforms with responsive, secure, and user-focused designs.

Some of my key projects include:

Sarathi — a comprehensive mental health platform with chat, video calls, and community features.

RupeeKart — a full-featured e-commerce platform with Razorpay payment integration and AI chatbot support.

AlumniHub — an AI-powered alumni networking platform with mentorship and community modules.

Beyond development, I’m an avid problem solver with 300+ DSA problems solved and a 5⭐ Gold Badge in Problem Solving on HackerRank. I’ve also earned top honors in several competitions — 1st place at Appmania 2024 and the Innovative Project Competition 2024, 3rd place at the Business Plan Innovation Competition, and recognition in the Top 30 at Hack-O-NIT 2024.

I’m always exploring new technologies, collaborating on innovative ideas, and striving to create user-centric, AI-driven web solutions that blend performance with purpose.Hi, I’m Sujal Agarwal, a Computer Science and Engineering student (2022–2026) at B.P.
